Library Management Project:
Library management system: in this project we can easily manage the book, track them, if we want. 
The simple user interface can help us to track the status of all available books in the library, search them based on their names, etc.
first:In this project I have created and populated data in 7 tables as following 
tbl_book_copies
tbl_library_branch
tbl_book
tbl_borrower
tbl_book_loans
tbl_publisher
tbl_book_authors
second: I stored procedure query questions as followed:
1- How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by the library branch whose name is "Sharpstown"?
2- How many copies of the book titled "The Lost Tribe" are owned by each library branch?
3- Retrieve the names of all borrowers who do not have any books checked out.
4- For each book that is loaned out from the "Sharpstown" branch and whose DueDate is today,
 retrieve the book title, the borrower's name, and the borrower's address. 
5- For each library branch, retrieve the branch name and the total number of books loaned out from that branch.  
6- Retrieve the names, addresses, and number of books checked out for all borrowers who have more than five books checked out. 
7- For each book authored by "Stephen King", retrieve the title and the number of copies owned by the library branch whose name is "Central".
